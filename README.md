# Cron Service - Node.js Simple And Fast

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Cron Service - Node.js Simple And Fast**, a lightweight, efficient, and easy-to-use scheduling library for Node.js applications. This project is designed to facilitate the scheduling of asynchronous tasks, making it an essential tool for developers looking to automate operations, perform routine data fetches, send notifications, and more.

## Project Overview

**Cron Service - Node.js Simple And Fast** provides a straightforward way to manage time-based tasks in Node.js applications. It leverages the power of asynchronous JavaScript to perform scheduled tasks without blocking the main thread, ensuring your application remains responsive.

### Key Features:

- **Simple Integration:** Designed with simplicity in mind, integrating this service into your Node.js project is straightforward, requiring minimal setup.
- **Lightweight Design:** The service is built to be lightweight, ensuring minimal impact on your application's performance.
- **Flexible Scheduling:** Offers the flexibility to schedule tasks at various intervals - from seconds to days, allowing for precise control over task execution.
- **Error Handling:** Includes robust error handling mechanisms, ensuring that your scheduled tasks are reliable and your application remains stable.
- **Telegram Notifications:** Features the ability to send notifications via Telegram, providing instant alerts on task failures or important events.
- **Independent Scheduling:** Tasks are managed independently, ensuring that the delay or failure of one task does not impact the execution of others.
- **Custom Time Windows:** Supports scheduling tasks within custom time windows, allowing tasks to run only during specified hours.

### Getting Started

To get started with **Cron Service - Node.js Simple And Fast**, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alicomert/Cron-Service-Simple-And-Fast-Nodejs.git
```

Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd Cron-Service-Simple-And-Fast-Nodejs
npm install
```

### Usage

Here's a simple example to demonstrate how to schedule a task:

```javascript
const { fetchDataWithTiming } = require('./path-to-service');

// Define your URLs and scheduling parameters
const urls = [
  'https://api.example.com/data',
  'https://api.example.com/notification',
];

const schedules = [
  { delay: 10000 }, // First URL: 10 seconds delay
  { start: '19:00', end: '22:00', delay: 0 }, // Second URL: Specific time window
];

// Start the task scheduling
fetchDataWithTiming(urls, schedules);
```

### Customizing Task Scheduling

You can customize the scheduling for each task by modifying the `schedules` array. Each element in the array corresponds to a task, with properties to define the start time, end time, and delay.
